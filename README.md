# Python Mastery: 700 Project Challenge

Welcome to the **700 Project Challenge**! This journey is designed to help you master Python by working through progressively complex projects. By the end of this challenge, you'll gain a deep understanding of Python's syntax, logic, data structures, web scraping, automation, application building, and advanced topics.

## Project Structure

### 1. Basic Syntax and Foundations (Projects 1-100)
These projects will help you build a strong foundation in Python basics, including data types, operators, and simple functions.

1. **Hello World Program** - Print "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. **Simple Calculator** - Take two numbers and an operator as input, then perform the operation.
3. **Number Swapper** - Swap two variables without using a third variable.
4. **Odd or Even Checker** - Check if a number is odd or even.
5. **Prime Checker** - Determine if a number is prime.
6. **Factorial Calculator** - Calculate the factorial of a given number.
7. **Fibonacci Sequence Generator** - Generate the first `n` numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
8. **Multiplication Table Generator** - Print a multiplication table for numbers 1-10.
9. **Power Calculator** - Calculate `x^y` using a loop.
10. **Palindrome Checker** - Check if a word or number is a palindrome.

## Scaling Up to 700 Projects
Each category can be expanded with project variations and increased complexity. Here are a few ideas for additional projects within each category:

- **Enhanced Calculator** (Basic Syntax) - Add scientific functions like `sin`, `cos`, `log`.
- **Multi-Player Quiz Game** (Control Flow) - Add multiple players and rounds to the quiz game.
- **Image Scraper** (Web Scraping) - Extend the scraper to download images from websites.
- **Task Scheduler** (Applications) - Automate daily tasks and notifications based on preferences.

By following this roadmap and completing all 700 projects, you will gain a deep understanding of Python and build the skills to tackle any programming challenge. 

Good luck, and happy coding!
